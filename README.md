# UnityOnLinuxTest

This project is based on the [experimental Linux build of Unity 5.1.0f3] (http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/).

The project has been configured (according to [this recommendation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18225126/how-to-use-git-for-unity-source-control/18225479#18225479)) to use text-based configuration files instead of binary ones.
